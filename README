INTRO
=====

This distribution contains modified versions of the 'acceptRej.pl' script
distributed with msbayes version 20100519, available at:

http://msbayes.sourceforge.net/

These modifications are minimal, and so any publication resulting from the
use of these scripts should cite the original work:

 Huang, W., N. Takebayashi, Y. Qi, and M. J. Hickerson, 2011. MTML-msBayes:
   Approximate Bayesian comparative phylogeographic inference from multiple
   taxa and multiple loci with rate heterogeneity. BMC Bioinformatics 12:1.

SUMMARY OF MODIFICATIONS
========================

An original, unmodified version of the program (acceptRej.pl.original) is
provided as a reference. 

The script 'acceptRej.pl' provided here simply modifies how the temporary
files produced during execution are handled. My version places all the
temporary files in folder within the current working directory. The intention
of this change was to make the program more friendly to run on shared 
computer clusters. Furthermore, the file containing the uncorrected posterior
sample is never deleted in my version, and the user can specify a path for
this file using the '-z' option (the default is './uncorrected_posterior.txt').

The script 'acceptRej_flex.pl' has the same modifications discussed above,
and in addition, allows the user to use summary statistics other than those
produced by the msbayes package. The original version had very strict
expectations for the number of summary statistic columns and their headers,
and deduced the number of taxonomic comparisons being analyzed from this
information. 'acceptRej_flex.pl' allows the user to use any number of
summary statistics and use arbitrary header names. NOTE: as a result of
this flexibility, the user MUST SPECIFY THE NUMBER OF TAXON PAIRS AT
INVOCATION USING THE '-x' OPTION.

USING THIS PROGRAM
==================

The PERL scripts provided here are useless on there own. They are modified
versions of a script from the msbayes package (http://msbayes.sourceforge.net/)
and are only useful in the context of this package. Currently, they are only
verified to work with version 20100519 of the package.

The easiest way to use these scripts is to first download, install, and test
the msbayes package. Then, simply replace the installed 'acceptRej.pl' file
with one of the versions provided here (I recommend changing the name of the
original script so you can revert back to it at anytime). Then you can use
the msbayes pipeline as normal, with the additional options discussed above
available when you get to the accept/reject step.
